																		FOR DESKTOP
			Transparent nav bar with a h1, 4 links, and 3 icons linking to the following media; Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram
			under the transparentness and spanning roughly 80% of the screen is a background of a bar, This is classified as home-header.jpg
			The next section is followed by OUR FOOD, has 9 img's to work with, spaced evenly and in the middle. Background is a blueish-black, leaning towards black
			Said pictures are 3x3, and the last row has a white line near the bottom of it going through the page, beleived to be a clarical error
			Next section is About us, Contains a h1 , an h2, and a p
			the text is cut off/ squished, likely a clarical error and not the real intention
			Background is a group of young gentlemen, reference Staff Cooks
			After the img there will be div classified as spacer for the page, about 20rem in height
			Next is contact us, h1, 3 h2's, and either a series of p's or h3's
			This will contain the Address, Hours, and contacts, Remember to look up the classifications for the stuff
			Display will be 3 separate columns, spaced evenly it would seem
			should append CONTACT US as well as Hours as one class for ease of use
			At the bottom is a footer, Contains a h1 and 4 links(look top). Also, there is a box to input a email address with a button attached to it, look into how to classify a box as such with a EMAIL ONLY type of deal
			near the bottom in small text is a Copyright, that might have a special classifier so look into that
		 -->
		 <!-- 
																FOR MOBILE
			Same transparentness, BLOOMTECH BAR AND GRILL should break at Bloomtech, the a's should be put into a column, social media should be spaced closer with a gap possibly
			Next section, all 9 img's will space to fill the screen with some margin/padding between them
			About US section, same deal, Also, for this background and the header one, width should fill out and only show a part of the picture, not be scrunched up
			Contact us, All in a column once again, Contact us needs to be near the top. Might require some jankery of moving the HTML, or reverse the flow.
			All text up until this point has stayed the same
			spacer
			give a class to the email address input and the button and make it column, sign up button should be long basically
			Increase size of a's near the bottom for better use
			Everything is gonna be centered
